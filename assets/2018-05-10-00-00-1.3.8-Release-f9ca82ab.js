description: 'World map clue overlay, friend notes, hot-cold helper, and special attack counter'
author: Adam

Clue scroll locations are now shown on the in-game world map. Thanks to
[@MESLewis](https://github.com/MESLewis) for his work on this over the past
weeks.

A friend notes plugin has been added which lets you associate notes to friends
on your friends list.

[@Eadgars-Ruse](https://github.com/Eadgars-Ruse) added a hot-cold helper to the
clue plugin which helps you narrow down which location the clue is at each time
you check the orb. It marks the possible locations to dig on the map.

A special attack counter was added which counts draining special attacks done
against certain bosses like the Corporeal Beast.

A FPS plugin was added from [@LeviSchuck](https://github.com/LeviSchuck) which
displays the current FPS, and allows you to configure a max FPS limit.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Fix agility plugin calculating laps to level when you level up on a lap
- Add missing Rellekka fishing spots to fishing plugin
- XP globes mouseover now shows xp per hour
- Fix date placement in screenshot with stretched fixed mode
- Fix xp tracker sometimes showing negative XP
- Fix bank tags to be case insensitive
- Add Puro-Puro static spawn locations to imp plugin
- A chest price evaluator was added to the barrows plugin

Enjoy!

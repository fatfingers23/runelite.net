So, I am happy to present you the new site. This site replaces the old one, what
was generated by GitHub pages.

This new site is using latest web development technologies, focusing on
performance, user-friendliness and responsivity. It is still new, so if you will
have any problems with the site, feel free to submit issue on it's
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/runelite/runelite.net/issues).

Also, if you want to contribute, it has never been easier, as the individual
blog posts are rendered from Markdown, so all you need to do to create new blog
post is to submit Pull Request to the repository with new Markdown file in
format \`YYYY-DD-MM-My-Post-Title.md\` in the \`src/_posts\` directory.

Well, all I can say now is, enjoy!

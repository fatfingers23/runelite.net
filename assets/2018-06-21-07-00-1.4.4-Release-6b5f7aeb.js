A Mage Training Arena was added from
[@Jasper Ketelaar](https://github.com/Jasper-ketelaar) which can solve
telekinetic mazes, and deduce alchemy room rotations from discovery of items in
it.

The prayer plugin now indicates when you can drink a prayer potion to get the
full effect by flashing the prayer orb. It also has a new tooltip which shows
your current prayer bonus and approximation on how much longer your prayer
points will last.

The boosts plugin now takes into account the preserve prayer when showing when
the next stat drain takes place.

The grand exchange plugin can now show the "actively traded" OSBuddy price on
the grand exchange interface now, if enabled.

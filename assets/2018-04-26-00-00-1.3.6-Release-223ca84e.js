description: 'Tile marking, clue bugfixes, and entity hider'

A tile marker plugin has been added which allows you to highlight arbitrary
tiles by holding shift and selecting "Mark". The markers are saved with your
client settings, and work even in instances.

Agility shortcuts throughout the game are now highlighted, and the agility
plugin now highlights marks of grace:

A fairy ring location plugin was added which tells you the location fairy rings
are configured to:

An entity hider plugin was added which lets you hide other players and npcs from
view.

There has been a large effort to fix and correct all of the clues from the
cluescroll plugin. I expect a few more releases before it is solid, but it
should no longer point at random objects anymore.

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Opponent info should no longer sometimes show "null" for opponent name
- The infoboxes now have a configurable wrap limit, and can be configured to
  stack verically instead.
- Support for slayer braclets have been added to the slayer plugin
- The MLM plugin now only shows veins on the same floor as you are
- Fix notes plugin to textwrap
- Add kingdom of misc. to screenshot plugin
- The length XP globes are shown is now configurable
- Fix client resizing itself when the plugin panel is collapsed and the client
  is maximized
- Color HP xp drops when praying too if XP drops are split
- "Actions Left" has been added to XP globes

Enjoy!

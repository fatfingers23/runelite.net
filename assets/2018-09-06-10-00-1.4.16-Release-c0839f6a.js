description: 'Layoutable Runescape widgets, top-center snap point, and automatic bounty target hiscore lookup'
author: Jordan

RuneScape widgets are now layoutable, meaning they can be anchored to the overlay hotspots like
Runelite overlays. Thanks to [@Deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam) for this feature!

A top-center snap point has been added, and the XP Globes plugin has been set to use it by default,
also thanks to [@Deathbeam](https://github.com/deathbeam).

An option has been added to the hiscore plugin to automatically look up bounty targets when they are
assigned, thanks to [@noelkeijzer](https://github.com/noelkeijzer).

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- Loot tracker now behaves correctly when multiple enemies die on same tick,
  when player is despawned and when receiving Theatre of Blood drops
- Some common items have been added to the ground item plugin's hidden items list by default
- The idle logout timer supports checking the logout timer when in combat
- The dense essence idle animation has been fixed and will correctly trigger the idle notifier
- The fossil island oxygen bar and pest control info widgets are now movable
- Some noisy plugin features have been disabled by default, or made to display only when in use
- "Trade-with" is now swapped also with the trade option of the menu entry swapper plugin
- Fixed the magic training arena dragonstone hint arrow not being cleared
- Prayer and run orb tooltips no longer display when the minimap is hidden
- The run energy tooltip now shows remaining energy when the orb shows run time remaining
- Some achievement diary requirements texts have been corrected
- Various skill calculator entries have been re-ordered to come in level requirement order
- Ourania teleport has been added to the skill calculator
- Fixed binding necklace charge counter when checking a necklace with one charge

Enjoy!

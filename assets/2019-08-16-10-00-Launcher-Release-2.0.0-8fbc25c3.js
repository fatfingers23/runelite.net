The launcher has been updated to 2.0. This release bundles Java 11, and if you
wish to run the jar directly, requires Java 11. It also includes a new loading
splash screen with improved error handling if there is an error when launching
the client.

Launcher updates require manually downloading and installing the new launcher.
However if you do not have problems with the existing version I would not
recommend downloading the newer one just because it is newer.

The Windows binaries remain digitially signed by \`Alexander Henne\` for
verification. Regardless, Windows SmartScreen tends to block new executables
anyway, so if it doesn't work try downloading the [old
launcher](https://github.com/runelite/launcher/releases/download/1.6.0/RuneLiteSetup32.exe) instead.

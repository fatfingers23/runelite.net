A [Status Bars plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Status-Bars) has been added, which
will display hitpoints and prayer information on the columns of the inventory, or along the left
side of the inventory panel. Big thanks to [@Malfuryent](https://github.com/Malfuryent) for their
tireless work maintainng this plugin for months preparing for its addition to the client.

[As we've announced on Twitter](https://twitter.com/RuneLiteClient/status/1062440996401790977), we
will soon be releasing the highly-anticipated GPU plugin. Keep on the lookout!

There are also several smaller improvements and bug fixes, including:

- A bug causing the [XP Tracker plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Tracker) to
  improperly display combat skills with strange values has been fixed
- Menu entry swaps will no longer affect NPCs with hint arrows above them to aid clue hunters
- The [Grand Exchange plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Grand-Exchange) panel has
  had its color scheme updated to better match the rest of the client
- The [Friend Notes plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Friend-Notes) now uses the
  updated chatbox dialog
- [XP globes](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/XP-Globes) are now ordered statically, and
  will not change order based on the time skill experience is received
- A Myth's guild cannon spot for blue dragons has been highlighted in the [Cannon
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Cannon)
- Shortcuts for a stile in Taverly and the stairs to the task-restricted Skeletal wyverns area are
  now highlighted in the [Agility plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Agility)
- The [Barrows Brothers plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Barrows-Brothers)'s
  overlay panel now displays reward potential and utilizes custom minimap colors in its minimap
  overlay
- Icons for the new portal nexus and mounted jewellery have been added to the [Player-owned house
  plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Player-owned-House)
- A [menu entry swapper](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Menu-Entry-Swapper) option has
  been added to swap the Private and Shared options of the Chambers of Xeric chest
- Overlays can no longer get stuck offscreen when switching between fixed and resizable views
- The [Diary Requirements plugin](https://github.com/runelite/runelite/wiki/Diary-Requirements) now
  displays combat level requirements for achievements requiring them

Enjoy!
